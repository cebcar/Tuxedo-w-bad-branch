# Open Source

Reference: [Digital Ocean Tutorials: An Introduction to Open Source](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorial_series/an-introduction-to-open-source)


We hope to work on and/or develop Open Source software.
We also intend to utilize Open Source software in our own work.

From the tutorials in the reference above, it is clear that we have a lot to learn.

Getting started could involve contributing to documentation for software we use.
That would require learning about Open Source expectations and handling of pull requests.

Publishing Open Source software would require substantial changes to the project,
although observation suggests that such projects are normally moved into a separate project for publication.
