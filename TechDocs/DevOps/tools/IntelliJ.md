# Using IntelliJ Platform IDEs

## IntelliJ Tasks

We use IntelliJ [Tasks](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/managing-tasks-and-context.html)
  to organize work into smaller tasks.

The Task workflow helps keep our workflow anchored.

Features Include:
- automatically offers configurable suggestions for branch and changelist names
- saves and restores context
- context: branch, open files, favorites, breakpoints, tool window status
- stashes (or shelves) existing changes when switching between branches
- available automatic time tracking per Task

### Conventions

- top-level Task normally named for an issue
  - &lt;Proj&gt;#&lt;issueNum&gt; &lt;issueSummary&gt;, 
      using the full project and issue names as proposed by IntelliJ
- branch name abbreviated by hand from IntelliJ-proposed branch name
  - edit to &lt;ph&gt;&lt;issueNum&gt;-&lt;abbreviatedIssueName&gt;,
    where 'ph' is a hardcoded project name
- top-level Task can have multiple branches
  - then branch names replace &lt;issueSummary&gt; with &lt;branchSummary&gt;

## Open Repository as Project

#### create project from repo
- Get Repo from Version Control
  - menu VCS/Git : Clone
    - supply:
      - repository URL
      - directory of the new project
    - press Enter or click Clone<br/><br/>

- Settings: connect to repository
  - File : Manage IDE Settings : Settings Repository
    - select cebcar/ij-settings; overwrite local

#### expand .gitignore

- gitignore.io: add content for macOS and JetBrains; inspect; remove duplicate line .DS_Store

#### connect to GitHub repo
- [Create Personal Access Token](GitHub.md#create-personal-access-token) "JetBrains-GitHub Integration: &lt;projectName&gt;"; copy content to clipboard
- from Preferences : Tools : Tasks : Servers :
  - add new server (`+` or cmd-N); supply GitHub Organization and Repo name; paste in token
  - `Test` to verify connection; Apply

#### commit to Version Control
- Tag and Commit
  - add annotated tag, normally "vYY.0.1" for a new project, with message
- commit; push
  
## Special Documentation Files

### Workflows

Groups of steps in workflows are routinely enclosed in braces to denote sections,
much like groups of steps in code.
```
- ( until | while | ... ) <bold-label> {
  - <steps>
- } <bold-label>
```

This syntax creates issues with the 'Unpaired symbol' Inspection.
To avoid these errors, disable 'Unpaired Symbol' for *.md and *.html files.

<button onclick="window.print()">`Print Button`</button>
