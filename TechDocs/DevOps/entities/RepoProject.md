# Repo Project

Repo Project is a multi-faceted project for development.
At this time, its facets are:
- GitHub
  - hosting for git repository(ies)
  - storage of Issues, Issue labels, other project details
  - automation for some aspects of devops workflow via Actions
<br/><br/>
- ZenHub
  - Kanban boards for project and issue management
  - Roadmaps, Initiatives and Epics/Projects for a high-level view of product development
    - in ZenHub, Initiatives are shown as groups of Projects with no content.
      - we use Epics with label Initiative to support that planning level
  - Projects and Epics for planning based on Feature development
  - Issues with IntelliJ Tasks for implementing Feature development
  - Releases and Milestones/Sprints for time-based planning
<br/><br/>
- IntelliJ IDE
  - extensive build tools for all expected coding and documentation requirements
